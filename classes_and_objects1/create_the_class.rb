# create_the_class.rb
# Create an empty class named `Cat`.

class Cat
end

# Class creation is similar to defining a method, but rather than using the
# reserved word `def`, we use `class`.
# Also, the class name uses the `CamelCase` format rather than the `snake_case`
# format used with methods.
# Formatting in a manner consistant with accepted standards is good practice,
# ignoring best practices will not cause a logic or runtime error.
